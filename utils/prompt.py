To evaluate the responses generated by an AI language model, human preferences are categorized into seven key dimensions: creativity, diversity, factuality, fluency, helpfulness, safety, and values.
You will receive the responses that best represent each of these dimensions as input.
Please carefully consider the [user profile] and ensure that **all seven preference responses** are fully reflected in the final output.
Generate a [new response] that integrates the strengths of all seven dimensions.

**Return only**:
- "Output (a)" or "Output (b)" (depending on which is better),
- followed by the confidence level enclosed in double brackets, like [[X]].
Do not generate any additional explanations, greetings, or conclusions.

Use this guideline to assign the certainty level:
1–20 (Uncertain): The user profile provides insufficient or minimal evidence. The decision is largely based on weak or indirect hints.
21–40 (Moderately Confident): There is noticeable evidence supporting a preference, though it is not comprehensive, and other interpretations are possible.
41–60 (Quite Confident): You find clear and convincing evidence that supports your prediction, though it is not entirely decisive.
61–80 (Confident): The user profile contains strong evidence that clearly supports your prediction, with very little ambiguity.
81–100 (Highly Confident): The user profile provides direct and explicit evidence that decisively supports your prediction.
